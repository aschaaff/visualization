Visualization experiments

We started in April 2014 a study about the use of Immersive-3D for astronomical data.
The fisrt experiments are related on several GitHub repositories.

In October 2014 we started a new phase of the study with the improvement of the visualization of data cubes and especially the test or the development of methods to enable this for large datasets on a standard device (desktop/laptop, tablets).

The source code of the experiments will be available on this repository.
